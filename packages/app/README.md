## Usage

Dependencies for these templates are managed with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) using `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That said, any package manager will work. This file can safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## E2E Testing

Playwright starts the Vite dev server automatically via `webServer`, and UI tests expect an opencode backend at `localhost:4096` by default.

```bash
bunx playwright install chromium
bun run test:e2e:local
bun run test:e2e:local -- --grep "settings"
```

Environment options:

- `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_HOST` / `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_PORT` (backend address, default: `localhost:4096`)
- `PLAYWRIGHT_PORT` (Vite dev server port, default: `3000`)
- `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` (override base URL, default: `http://localhost:<PLAYWRIGHT_PORT>`)

### 办公/AIPPT E2E

```bash
bunx @playwright/test@1.59.1 install chromium
bun dev serve
bun run test:e2e:local -- --grep office
```

`office.spec.ts` 覆盖办公模式进入、全部办公场景切换、真实 PPT 模板选择与逐页预览、会话模板锁定、Provider 设置入口和项目目录选择。需要本地 API 监听 `4096`，测试不会触发真实模型生成。

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
